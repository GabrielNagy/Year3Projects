Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
The purpose of this thesis is to shed light on Buildbot as a Continuous
 Integration tool.
 Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and
 testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.
 We target to do this by automating most of the delivery process related
 tasks, freeing the developer to do other software development related tasks.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
Using Buildbot, developers cand test their components for possible errors
 without the risk of committing to version control and breaking the code.
 Buildbot is an open source project, written in Python on top of the Twisted
 network programming framework.

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, every software company, regardless how large or small, uses Continuou
s Integration principles.
 Verifying and testing code before delivering and merging with the mainline
 is of paramount importance, as it saves money as well as time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While smaller companies might make use of more flexible ways of testing,
 the larger ones usually run a CI tool such as Jenkins, on which they run
 builds of every commit that finds its way to the master/trunk branch.
 This is a widespread and useful practice, albeit narrow, as it only tracks
 main branches.
 If a commit happens to break the code, the trunk gets locked and valuable
 time is spent to fix the regressions.
 What I will present in this thesis is how developers can use Buildbot as
 a tool to remotely test their software, without interfering with other
 people's work.
 We tell Buildbot the same step sequence the developer uses to test their
 code, and it does the job for us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By transferring these tasks to Buildbot, the developer can work on other
 important issues without worrying about the testing part.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Contribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though Buildbot is a powerful tool out-of-the-box, it really shines
 if properly customized and extended.
 Being an open-source project, it receives frequent contributions from users
 around the world.
 The codebase is modular and properly documented, and one can easily begin
 writing their own extensions and helpers.

 and his changes are instantly send to the Buildbot queue to be built
\end_layout

Structure

\begin_layout Standard
Besides presenting the technologies used, before getting into the extensibility
 of Buildbot, I will also shed light on some of its default implementations
 to see their purposes.

\begin_layout Chapter
Technologies used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition, Buildbot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required
 by most software projects to validate code changes.
 By automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each time something has
 changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly, before other developers
 are inconvenienced by the failure.
 By running the builds on a variety of platforms, developers who do not
 have the facilities to test their changes everywhere before checkin will
 at least know shortly afterwards whether they have broken the build or
 not.
 The overall goal is to reduce tree breakage and provide a platform to run
 tests or code-quality checks that are too annoying or pedantic for any
 human to waste their time with.
 Developers get immediate (and potentially public) feedback about their
 changes, encouraging them to be more careful about testing before checkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buildbot was written to automate the human process of walking into the
 office, updating a tree, compiling (and discovering the breakage), finding
 the developer at fault, and complaining to them about the problem they
 had introduced.
 With multiple platforms it was difficult for developers to do the right
 thing (compile their potential change on all platforms); the buildbot offered
 a way to help.

; Twisted comes with client and server implementations for all of its protocols,
 as well as utilities that make it easy to configure and deploy production-grade
 Twisted applications from the command line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twisted includes both high- and low-level tools for building performant,
 cross-platform applications.
 One can deploy a web or mail server with just a few lines of code, or one
 can write their own protocol from scratch.
 At every level, Twisted provides a tested, RFC-conforming, extensible API
 that makes it possible to rapidly develop powerful network software.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protocol/transport separation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twisted is designed for complete separation between logical protocols (usually
 relying on stream-based connection semantics, such as HTTP or POP3) and
 physical transport layers supporting such stream-based semantics (such
 as files, sockets or SSL libraries).
 Connection between a logical protocol and a transport layer happens at
 the last possible moment — just before information is passed into the logical
 protocol instance.
 The logical protocol is informed of the transport layer instance, and can
 use it to send messages back and to check for the peer's identity.
 Note that it is still possible, in protocol code, to deeply query the transport
 layer on transport issues (such as checking a client-side SSL certificate).
 Naturally, such protocol code will fail (raise an exception) if the transport
 layer does not support such semantics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Deferred API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Central to the Twisted application model is the concept of a deferred (elsewhere
 called a future).
 A deferred is an instance of a class designed to receive and process a
 result which has not been computed yet, for example because it is based
 on data from a remote peer.
 Deferreds can be passed around, just like regular objects, but cannot be
 asked for their value.
 Each deferred supports a callback chain.
 When the deferred gets the value, it is passed to the functions on the
 callback chain, with the result of each callback becoming the input for
 the next.
 Deferreds make it possible to arrange to operate on the result of a function
 call before its value has become available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if a deferred returns a string from a remote peer containing
 an IP address in quad format, a callback can be attached to translate it
 into a 32-bit number.
 Any user of the deferred can now treat it as a deferred returning a 32-bit
 number.
 This, and the related ability to define "errbacks" (callbacks which are
 called as error handlers), allows code to specify in advance what to do
 when an asynchronous event occurs, without stopping to wait for the event.
 In non-event-driven systems, for example using threads, the operating system
 incurs premature and additional overhead organizing threads each time a
 blocking call is made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Thread support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Twisted supports an abstraction over raw threads — using a thread as a deferred
 source.
 Thus, a deferred is returned immediately, which will receive a value when
 the thread finishes.
 Callbacks can be attached which will run in the main thread, thus alleviating
 the need for complex locking solutions.
 A prime example of such usage, which comes from Twisted's support libraries,
 is using this model to call into databases.
 The database call itself happens on a foreign thread, but the analysis
 of the result happens in the main thread.

 The server's job is to listen for TCP connections on a particular port

 a response, and terminate the connection.

NodeJS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Node.js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript
 code server-side.
 Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection
 from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications
 such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Node.js is intended to run on a dedicated HTTP server and to employ a single
 thread with one process at a time.
 Node.js applications are event-based and run asynchronously.
 Code built on the Node platform does not follow the traditional model of
 receive, process, send, wait, receive.
 Instead, Node processes incoming requests in a constant event stack and
 sends small requests one after the other without waiting for responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a shift away from mainstream models that run larger, more complex
 processes and run several threads concurrently, with each thread waiting
 for its appropriate response before moving on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the major advantages of Node.js, according to its creator Ryan Dahl,
 is that it does not block input/output (I/O).
 Some developers are highly critical of Node.js and point out that if a single
 process requires a significant number of CPU cycles, the application will
 block and that the blocking can crash the application.
 Proponents of the Node.js model claim that CPU processing time is less of
 a concern because of the high number of small processes that Node code
 is based on.

\begin_layout Standard
In the Node ecosystem, dependencies get placed within a 
\family typewriter
node_modules
\family default
 directory in your project.
 However, this file structure can differ from the actual dependency tree
 as duplicate dependencies are merged together.
 The npm client installs dependencies into the 
\family typewriter
node_modules
\family default
 directory non-deterministically.
 This means that based on the order dependencies are installed, the structure
 of a 
\family typewriter
node_modules
\family default
 directory could be different from one person to another.
 These differences can cause “works on my machine” bugs that take a long
 time to hunt down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yarn resolves these issues around versioning and non-determinism by using
 lockfiles and an install algorithm that is deterministic and reliable.
 These lockfiles lock the installed dependencies to a specific version,
 and ensure that every install results in the exact same file structure
 in

 across all machines.
 The written lockfile uses a concise format with ordered keys to ensure

 gulp reads the file system and pipes the data at hand from its one single-purpo
sed plugin to other through the .pipe() operator, doing one task at a time.
 The original files are not affected until all the plugins are processed.

Task-runners like gulp and grunt are built on Node.js rather than npm, because
 the basic npm scripts are inefficient when executing multiple tasks.

 Grunt runs tasks by transforming files and saves as new ones in temporary
 folders and the output of one task is taken as input for another and so
 on until the output reaches the destination folder.
 This involves a lot of I/O calls and creation of many temporary files.
 Whereas gulp streams through the file system and does not require any of
 these temporary locations decreasing the number of I/O calls thus, improving
 performance.

 The Schedulers are responsible for deciding when

 Some Buildbot installations might have a single scheduler, while others
 may have several, each for a different purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a 
\emph on
quick
\emph default
 scheduler might exist to give immediate feedback to developers, hoping
 to catch obvious problems in the code that can be detected quickly.
 These typically do not run the full test suite, nor do they run on a wide
 variety of platforms.
 They also usually do a VC update rather than performing a brand-new checkout
 each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A separate 
\emph on
full
\emph default
 scheduler might run more comprehensive tests, to catch more subtle problems.
 configured to run after the quick scheduler, to give developers time to
 commit fixes to bugs caught by the quick scheduler before running the comprehen
sive tests.
 This scheduler would also feed multiple 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builders
\family default
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many schedulers can be configured to wait a while after seeing a source-code
 change - this is the 
\emph on
tree stable timer
\emph default
.
 The timer allows multiple commits to be “batched” together.
 This is particularly useful in distributed version control systems, where
 a developer may push a long sequence of changes all at once.
 To save resources, it’s often desirable only to test the most recent change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schedulers can also filter out the changes they are interested in, based
 on a number of criteria.
 For example, a scheduler that only builds documentation might skip any
 changes that do not affect the documentation.
 Schedulers can also filter on the branch to which a commit was made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some support for configuring dependencies between builds - for
 example, you may want to build packages only for revisions which pass all
 of the unit tests.
 This support is under active development in Buildbot, and is referred to
 as “build coordination”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Periodic builds (those which are run every N seconds rather than after new

 Each

\series default
 as soon as it can (i.e.
 when an associated worker becomes free).
 
\family typewriter

 the

Builders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buildmaster runs a collection of 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
s, each of which handles a single type of build (e.g.
 full versus quick), on one or more workers.
 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
s serve as a kind of queue for a particular type of build.
 Each 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
 gets a separate column in the waterfall display.
 In general, each 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
 runs independently (although various kinds of interlocks can cause one
 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
 to have an effect on another).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each builder is a long-lived object which controls a sequence of 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Build
\family default
\series default
s.
 Each 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
 is created when the config file is first parsed, and lives forever (or
 rather until it is removed from the config file).
 It mediates the connections to the workers that do all the work, and is
 responsible for creating the 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Build
\family default
\series default
 objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each builder gets a unique name, and the path name of a directory where
 it gets to do all its work (there is a buildmaster-side directory for keeping
 status information, as well as a worker-side directory where the actual
 checkout/compile/test commands are executed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A builder also has a 
\family typewriter

BuildFactory
\family default
\series default

\family typewriter
\series bold
Build

\begin_layout Subsection
Builds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A build is a single compile or test run of a particular version of the source
 code, and is comprised of a series of steps.
 It is ultimately up to you what constitutes a build, but for compiled software
 it is generally the checkout, configure, make, and make check sequence.
 For interpreted projects like Python modules, a build is generally a checkout
 followed by an invocation of the bundled test suite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
\series bold
BuildFactory
\family default

 describes the steps a build will perform.
 The builder which starts a build uses its configured build factory to determine
 the build’s steps.

\begin_layout Subsection
Workers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each builder is associated with one of more 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Worker
\family default
\series default
s.
 A builder which is used to perform Mac OS X builds (as opposed to Linux
 or Solaris builds) should naturally be associated with a Mac worker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If multiple workers are available for any given builder, you will have some
 measure of redundancy: in case one worker goes offline, the others can
 still keep the 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
 working.
 In addition, multiple workers will allow multiple simultaneous builds for
 the same 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Builder
\family default
\series default
, which might be useful if you have a lot of forced or 
\family typewriter
try
\family default
 builds taking place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use this feature, it is important to make sure that the workers are
 all, in fact, capable of running the given build.
 The worker hosts should be configured similarly, otherwise you will spend
 a lot of time trying (unsuccessfully) to reproduce a failure that only
 occurs on some of the workers and not the others.
 Different platforms, operating systems, versions of major programs or libraries
, all these things mean you should use separate Builders.

Users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buildbot has a somewhat limited awareness of 
\emph on
users
\emph default
.
 It assumes the world consists of a set of developers, each of whom can
 be described by a couple of simple attributes.
 These developers make changes to the source code, causing builds which
 may succeed or fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users also may have different levels of authorization when issuing Buildbot
 commands, such as forcing a build from the web interface or from an IRC
 channel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each developer is primarily known through the source control system.
 Each 
\family typewriter

To do more with the User than just refer to them, this username needs to

\begin_layout Subsection
Build Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each build has a set of 
\emph on
Build Properties
\emph default
, which can be used by its build steps to modify their actions.
 These properties, in the form of key-value pairs, provide a general framework
 for dynamically altering the behavior of a build based on its circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Properties form a simple kind of variable in a build.
 Some properties are set when the build starts, and properties can be changed
 as a build progresses – properties set or changed in one step may be accessed
 in subsequent steps.
 Property values can be numbers, strings, lists, or dictionaries - basically,
 anything that can be represented in JSON.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Properties are very flexible, and can be used to implement all manner of
 functionality.
 Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most Source steps record the revision that they checked out in the 
\family typewriter
got_revision
\family default
 property.
 A later step could use this property to specify the name of a fully-built
 tarball, dropped in an easily-accessible directory for later testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some projects want to perform nightly builds as well as building in response
 to committed changes.
 Such a project would run two schedulers, both pointing to the same set
 of builders, but could provide an 
\family typewriter
is_nightly
\family default
 property so that steps can distinguish the nightly builds, perhaps to run
 more resource-intensive tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some projects have different build processes on different systems.
 Rather than create a build factory for each worker, the steps can use worker
 properties to identify the unique aspects of each worker and adapt the
 build process dynamically.

\begin_layout Subsection
Data API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data layer combines access to stored state and messages, ensuring consistenc
y between them, and exposing a well-defined API that can be used both internally
 and externally.
 Using caching and the clock information provided by the db and mq layers,
 this layer ensures that its callers can easily receive a dump of current
 state plus changes to that state, without missing or duplicating messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data API is divided into four sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
getters - fetching data from the database API;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
subscriptions - subscribing to messages from the mq layer;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
control - allows state to be changed in specific ways by sending appropriate
 messages (e.g., stopping a build);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
updates - direct updates to state appropriate messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The getters and subscriptions are exposed everywhere.
 Access to the control section should be authenticated at higher levels,
 as the data layer does no authentication.
 The updates section is for use only by the process layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interfaces for all sections but the updates sections are intended to
 be language-agnostic.
 That is, they should be callable from JavaScript via HTTP, or via some
 other interface added to Buildbot after the fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Updates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The updates section defines a free-form set of methods that Buildbot’s process
 implementation calls to update data.
 Most update methods both modify state via the database API and send a message
 via the message queue API.
 Some are simple wrappers for these APIs, while others contain more complex
 logic, e.g., building a source stamp set for a collection of changes.
 This section is the proper place to put common functionality, e.g., rebuilding
 builds or assembling buildsets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data API enforces a strong and well-defined model on Buildbot’s data.
 This model is influenced by REST, in the sense that it defines resources,
 representations for resources, and identifiers for resources.
 For each resource type, the API specifies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the attributes of the resource and their types (e.g., changes have a string
 specifying their project);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the format of links to other resources (e.g., buildsets to sourcestamp sets);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the paths relating to the resource type;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the format of routing keys for messages relating to the resource type;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the events that can occur on that resource (e.g., a buildrequest can be claimed);
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
options and filters for getting resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some resource type attributes only appear in certain formats, as noted in
 the documentation for the resource types.
 In general, messages do not include any optional attributes, nor links.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paths are given here separated by slashes, with key names prefixed by 
\family typewriter
:
\family default
 and described below.
 Similarly, message routing keys given here are separated by dots, with
 key names prefixed by 
\family typewriter
$
\family default
.
 The translation to tuples and other formats should be obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All strings in the data model are unicode strings.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Web interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the goals of the ‘nine’ project is to rework Buildbot’s web services
 to use a more modern, consistent design and implement UI features in client-sid
e JavaScript instead of server-side Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rationale behind this is that a client side UI relieves pressure on
 the server while being more responsive for the user.
 The web server only concentrates on serving data via a REST interface wrapping
 the Data API.
 This removes a lot of sources of latency where, in previous versions, long
 synchronous calculations were made on the server to generate complex pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another big advantage is live updates of status pages, without having to
 poll or reload.
 The new system uses Comet techniques in order to relay Data API events
 to connected clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, making web services an integral part of Buildbot, rather than a
 status plugin, allows tighter integration with the rest of the application.

The 
\family typewriter
www
\family default
 service exposes three pieces via HTTP:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A REST interface wrapping Data API;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTTP-based messaging protocols wrapping the Messaging and Queues interface;
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Static resources implementing the client-side UI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The REST interface is a very thin wrapper: URLs are translated directly
 into Data API paths, and results are returned directly, in JSON format,
 based on the JSON API.
 Control calls are handled with a simplified form of JSONRPC 2.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The message interface is also a thin wrapper around Buildbot’s MQ mechanism.
 Clients can subscribe to messages, and receive copies of the messages,
 in JSON, as they are received by the buildmaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The client-side UI is an AngularJS application.
 Buildbot uses the Python setuptools entry-point mechanism to allow multiple
 packages to be combined into a single client-side experience.
 This allows frontend developers and users to build custom components for
 the web UI without hacking Buildbot itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Python development and AngularJS development are very different processes,
 requiring different environment requirements and skillsets.
 To maximize hackability, Buildbot separates the two cleanly.
 An experienced AngularJS hacker should be quite comfortable in the www/
 directory, with a few exceptions described below.
 Similarly, an experienced Python hacker can simply download the pre-built
 web UI and never venture near the www/ directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
URLs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Buildbot web interface is rooted at its base URL, as configured by the
 user.
 It is entirely possible for this base URL to contain path components, e.g.,
 
\family typewriter
http://build.example.org/buildbot/
\family default
, if hosted behind an HTTP proxy.
 To accomplish this, all URLs are generated relative to the base URL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the space under the base URL looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/
\family default
 – The HTML document that loads the UI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/api/v{version}
\family default
 – The root of the REST APIs, each versioned numerically.
 Users should, in general, use the latest version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/ws
\family default
 – The WebSocket endpoint to subscribe to messages from the mq system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
/sse
\family default
 – The server sent event endpoint where clients can subscribe to messages
 from the mq system.

\begin_layout Section
Backend componentization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the Buildbot master configuration resides in the 
\family typewriter
master.cfg
\family default
 file in the buildmaster's base directory.
 A sample file is automatically installed when a new master is created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The config file is written in Python and it defines a dictionary named 
\family typewriter
BuildmasterConfig
\family default
, with a number of keys that are specially treated.
 Being a pythonic configuration, we can benefit from the features of the
 programming language, such as componentization of the configuration parts
 into modules.
 This comes in handy when we are dealing with large configurations.
 At first the 
\family typewriter
master.cfg
\family default
 file seems suitable, but as we add more builders and workers, we need to
 keep the code readable, thus we split 
\family typewriter
master.cfg
\family default
 into multiple modules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure below illustrates this componentization for the Nokia Buildbot
 project, which has 4 projects running on the same master (CAS, INCT, FRI,
 DEM), each of them having an arbitrary number of builders (
\family typewriter
builders
\family default
 subfolder) and a specific web dashboard (
\family typewriter
dashboard
\family default
 subfolder).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the build steps have log outputs that do not match Buildbot's default
 parsers, so custom logparsers have been implemented (
\family typewriter
builders/steps
\family default
 subfolder).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Custom notifiers have the purpose of informing the user/admin about vital
 build or system information, the current implemented one uses LDAP to query
 the active directory in order to find the e-mail address of an user (
\family typewriter
notifier
\family default
 subfolder).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the project increases in size, metrics become necessary.
 We use Prometheus to keep track of information, and Grafana to crunch it
 and present it in an user-friendly way (
\family typewriter
reporters
\family default
 subfolder).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these components could be worked into the 
\family typewriter
master.cfg
\family default
 file, but the result would be an approx.
 2300 line configuration file that encompasses each category, making code
 modifications and additions more prone to errors and most certainly a chore
 to go through.

\begin_layout Subsection
Email look-up using LDAP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Making users aware of their build status and results is an important part
 of the CI process.
 To keep user input to a minimum, we can figure out their e-mail address
 from their Linux username.
 For this purpose, we use Python's LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
 module to search through the active directory for the user's information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To send e-mails to users, Buildbot provides a 
\family typewriter
MailNotifier
\family default
 reporter that does most of the job.
 This is a basic example:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/mailnotifier_default.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{mailnotifier\\_default.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning our use case, we need to configure a proper 
\family typewriter
lookup
\family default
 function.
 For builds triggered by VCS commits, this is automatically managed by adding
 the e-mail addresses of the committers.
 However, try builds do not provide the e-mail parameter, so it has to be
 figured out using the user's Unix username.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Buildbot integration, we have to implement an 
\family typewriter
IEmailLookup
\family default
 interface that is provided by Buildbot.
 This interface has a 
\family typewriter
getAddress
\family default
 method that turns an username string into a valid e-mail address.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "email-lookup"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To implement the interface, we need to adapt the 
\family typewriter
ldapsearch
\family default
 to Python code:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/iemaillookup.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{IEmailLookup.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in the code, the class takes an optional argument, 
\family typewriter
emailsMap
\family default
, which is a dictionary of username and e-mail key/value pairs.
 This is usually done to avoid querying the Active Directory for an user
 that has used the system before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, to deploy this interface, we import it in the master configuration
 file, and we adjust our 
\family typewriter
MailNotifier
\family default
 reporter accordingly, also adding a HTML template as desired:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/mailnotifier_extended.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,comment={[l]{\\#}},commentstyle={\\color{gray}\\ttfamily\\textit},caption={\\textit{mailnotifier\\_extended.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, each time user-triggered builds on builders with the 
\family typewriter
cas
\family default
 tag are completed, the user receives an e-mail with the status of his build.
 If the user submitted a patchfile, it is also included in the e-mail.

Log parsing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buildbot provides a number of parsers for commonly used commands such as
 compilers (cmake, make, visual c++...) and tests (cppcheck, make test, trial...).
 However, there are special cases that do not fit the default parsers and
 custom ones have to be implemented.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it will be used in other sections, we will implement a simple parser
 for the 
\family typewriter
clang-tidy
\family default
 command.
 We begin by creating a new class that inherits the default 
\family typewriter
ShellCommand
\family default
.
 We provide the class with a 
\family typewriter
logConsumer
\family default
 function that incrementally gets every line of the command's output, and
 we feed the lines to the 
\family typewriter
gatherTestStatistics
\family default
 function that parses the lines.
 We use Python's regular expressions module to search for the desired content.
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/clangtidy_1.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{clangtidy.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
__init__
\family default
 function initializes our new 
\family typewriter
ShellCommand
\family default
, adding a log observer to the 
\family typewriter
stdio
\family default
 output, and providing initial fields for possible errors and warnings.
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/clangtidy_2.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{clangtidy.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command is mostly done as we successfully parsed its output.
 However, it must be evaluated in order to set a status after the step is
 finished.
 The evaluation is straightforward, if we have something in the 
\family typewriter
errors
\family default
 field, we mark the step as failed, if we have 
\family typewriter
warnings
\family default
 and no 
\family typewriter
errors
\family default
, we mark the step as having warnings (the build will not stop).
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/clangtidy_3.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{clangtidy.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We successfully implemented our parser, however the user does not know the
 error/warning count until he opens the log.
 To fix that, we can update the step's description with the count.
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/clangtidy_4.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{clangtidy.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have a fully working 
\family typewriter
clang-tidy
\family default
 command parser.
 It is a good practice to write unit tests for our code, so we make a generic
 test suite:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/clangtidy_test.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{clangtidy\\_test.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that remains to do is to import this class into the configuration file,
 and create the step using 
\family typewriter
steps.ClangTidy
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
steps.ShellCommand
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buildbot now correctly processes the output and updates the result accordingly:

\begin_layout Subsection
Preferential build steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our use cases, there is the possibility of patching more than one component
 in a build.
 By default, Buildbot executes all commands until failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
BuildStep
\family default
s are usually specified in the buildmaster’s configuration file, in a list
 that goes into the 
\family typewriter
BuildFactory
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
BuildStep
\family default
 instances in this list are used as templates to construct new independent
 copies for each build (so that state can be kept on the 
\family typewriter
BuildStep
\family default
 in one build without affecting a later build).
 Each 
\family typewriter
BuildFactory
\family default
 can be created with a list of steps, or the factory can be created empty
 and then steps added to it using the 
\family typewriter
addStep
\family default
 method:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/simple_factory.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{simple\\_factory.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we would like to execute only certain commands, depending on the
 status of the previous commands.
 To accomplish that, we need to know that Buildbot steps finish with a status
 described by one of four values defined in 
\family typewriter
buildbot.status.builder
\family default
: 
\family typewriter
SUCCESS
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
WARNINGS
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FAILURE
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
SKIPPED
\family default
.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "concepts-buildsteps"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's say that we have a builder that checks out a source, runs a linter
 and builds the code only if the lint step had no errors, then cleans up
 the build folder.
 An example for this use case can be seen below:
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand lstinputlisting
filename "code/preferential_factory.py"
lstparams "breaklines=true,captionpos=b,frame=b,language=Python,basicstyle={{\\ttm}},otherkeywords={self},keywordstyle={{\\ttb\\color{deepblue}}},stringstyle={{\\color{deepgreen}}},showstringspaces=false,captionpos=b,caption={\\textit{preferential\\_factory.py}}"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To skip a step, Buildbot provides us with the 
\family typewriter
doStepIf
\family default
 parameter for a 
\family typewriter
ShellCommand
\family default
 .
 The value is set to a lambda function that returns 
\family typewriter
True
\family default
 only if the previous step's result is 
\family typewriter
FAILURE
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
step.build.executedSteps
\family default
 is a list of the executed steps including the one that is running when
 the list is queried.
 We get the result of the 
\family typewriter
clang-tidy
\family default
 command by selecting the second to last executed step.
 In Python this is easily done by going backwards on the list, providing
 it with a negative value (
\family typewriter
[-2]
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end, we want to clean the workspace so it does not interfere with
 future builds.
 By default, Buildbot stops a build when a step fails.
 To override that, we provide the 
\family typewriter
rm -rf
\family default
 command with the 
\family typewriter
alwaysRun
\family default
 parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Web interface development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Buildbot's default web views (console, grid, waterfall) may be useful
 for some users, the real advantage lies in their customizability.
 We will build the same custom dashboard twice, once with Flask/WSGI, and
 once with Angular.
 At the end, we will compare and contrast the two approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flask/WSGI dashboards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simpler way, for most Python developers, is to use the 
\family typewriter
buildbot_wsgi_dashboards 
\family default
plugin to write a server side generated dashboard and integrate it in the
 UI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plugin is compatible with any WSGI web framework, we will use Flask
 as it is one of the more popular ones.
 A 
\family typewriter
/index.html
\family default
 route needs to be implemented, which will render the code representing
 the dashboard.
 The application framework runs in a thread outside of Twisted and it provides
 a synchronous wrapper for accessing the Data API.
 The HTML output is ran inside the Angular application, using its CSS and
 some of the directives defined by the Buildbot UI.
 It also has full access to the application JS context.
